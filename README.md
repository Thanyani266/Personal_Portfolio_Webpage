# Portfolio Webpage

### The task was to design a website of the porfolio that will give the reader an impression of who I am. And making sure that it appears in a good and presentable way.

#### The website consists of the following sections:
###### 1. Hero Section
The hero section is the first thing people see when they enter the portfolio website.
It is displayed under the header.
The hero section helps the reader to understand what the candidate offer, why someone should work with that candidate, and the value that the candidate provide with their services.
###### 2. About Section
A short summary about myself.
Including my education, work experience, projects and interests.
Helping the reader to understand what I am passionate about and the things that I'm really good at.
###### 3. Portfolio
The projects that have been done in the past.
###### 4. Services
The list of services that I offer
###### 5. Contact
Letting the reader know how and where they can get in touch.
Also added GitHub profile, LinkedIn, Youtube and so on.
